\title{Group effect for differential splicing}
\usage{
group_effect_rssm(design, coef)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{Design matrix.}

\item{coef}{Column number in design matrix of the coefficient to be tested.}
}
\value{
A group effect object.
}
\description{
Create a group effect object to detect differential splicing (or similar). The effect size is the root sum of squared differences of the coefficient from the mean.
}
\details{
The coefficient should represent a difference between two conditions.

The idea is to detect differences in differential expression between features in a group (ie exons in a gene).

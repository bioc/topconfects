# | (-‚óè Topconfects 
(Under development) TOP results by CONfident efFECT Size. Topconfects is intended for RNA-seq or microarray Differntial Expression analysis and similar, where we are interested in estimating many effect sizes -- one per gene -- from few samples.

Topconfects builds on [TREAT](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/6/765.long) p-values offered by the limma and edgeR packages. It tries a range of fold changes, and uses this to rank genes by effect size while maintaining a given FDR.

**Banish ridiculous p-values and q-values.** The difference between a p-value of 1e-6 and 1e-9 has no practical meaning. What matters are effect sizes. If your p-values are this small, *you should be rejecting a broader set of hypotheses*. For example, a confidence interval rejects values of a parameter outside of that interval, at a given significance level. Here we will be concentrating on rejecting values of a parameter smaller than some size.

**No need to guess the fold change.** TREAT is awesome, but it needs a fold change cutoff. You don't know the fold change, that's why you're doing an experiment. What you can say is a False Discovery Rate appropriate to your purpose. Topconfects then gives you a ranked list of the most interesting genes to look at by confident effect size.


## Future work

In a two-factor experiment where the interaction of factors is of interest, the interaction term of a linear model may not be a useful way to quantify of effect size. In Differential Expression, this will be a log odds ratio, log((b/a)/(d/c)), however a more interesting value might be the difference in proportions, b/(a+b)-d/(c+d).

Differential exon usage is an instance of this, in which exon becomes one of the factors in the experiment.

Another line for future work is effect sizes for gene-set enrichment tests. The smallest p-value does not necessarily imply the greatest interest. We may be more interested in sets with high Jaccard index, d/(b+c+d).
